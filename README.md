# TallyArbiter-M5AtomMatrixListener
This is a Tally Viewer using a M5 Atom Matrix as a TallyArbiter Client.
This is my attempt at 'mushing' arduino code.

# Instructions

1. Go to https://docs.m5stack.com/en/arduino/arduino_development follow the instructions under heading "Boards Manager"
2. Open tallyarbiter-m5atom.ino in Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
2. Update `networkSSID`, `networkPass` variable to match your Wifi network
3. Update `tallyarbiter_host` values to match your TallyArbiter installation
4. In Library Manager install FastLED, SocketIoClient, Arduino_JSON, WebSockets version 2.3.4, and MultiButton
6. Open `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/SocketIoClient/SocketIoClient.cpp` in a text editor. Find the line that says `hexdump(payload, length);` and comment it out by adding `//` to the beginning of the line. Save and close that file.
7. Go In the IDE go to Sketch -> Upload

## Troubleshooting

### Could Not Open Port
If you get `serial.serialutil.SerialException: [Errno 2] could not open port` go to `Tools` -> `Port` and select a different port (device) that starts with `/dev/cu.usbserial-â€¦` This willl happen if you are installing TallyArbitor on a number of M5Atoms.

### macOS
If you receive an error similar to `ImportError: No module named serial` reference: https://community.m5stack.com/post/11106

# Current Updates
* Tidyed up things a little bit
* Changed the way the LED's are written to now using the M5 library
* Added Blank and 1 thru 16 camera numbers by pushing the screen (M5 Action button)
* Fixed bugs

Note if deploying yourself, one of the librarys has an error where you have to manually comment out hexdump by changing it to //hexdump

# Planned Updates
Next Update will have Internal Motion Unit functionality to automatically rotate the screen.

# Thanks
Thanks to mg-1999 for the code base, and huge thanks to josephdadams for his amazing work on TallyArbiter, and the original M5StickC implementation.
